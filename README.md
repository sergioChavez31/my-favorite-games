This website was developed as part of Georgia Tech’s CS 1301 course to apply foundational concepts in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a personal blog-style layout that showcases a curated list of recommended video games, each with a brief description and visual styling.

To enhance interactivity, the site includes JavaScript-powered mini-games where users can answer fun questions. Based on their responses, the website dynamically changes its appearance or redirects users to a related YouTube video as a “reward.”

This project demonstrates beginner-level front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation, conditional logic, and event-driven design.
